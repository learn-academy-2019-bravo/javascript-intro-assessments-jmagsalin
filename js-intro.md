Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is an equation that you can put arguments through to create a desired outcome
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.

#### 2. What is a method?
A method is something that can be done to a data type
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
indexOf() concat() charAt()
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Mutators permanently change a string, accessors take an object and give it a value.  If you want to change one object and want to changee it permanantly you would use a mutator.  If you want to give multiple values to an object you would use accessors.
Accessors are getters and setters.  A mutator method is a method used to control changes to a variable. They are also widely known as setter methods.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() outputs the result to the console immediately, return calls the result of the function but doesn't output the result to the console.  console.log() would be used more for a final answer, returns are more for multiple answers within a function
The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller. The Console method log() outputs a message to the web console.  console.log is good for debugging.  Return is for you want a value and stop a function.
